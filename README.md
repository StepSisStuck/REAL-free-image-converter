# REAL Free Image Converter

Sometimes you just need to convert a file (like a TIFF to PNG) without all the hassle—especially when converting websites hide behind paywalls or claim to delete your files, leaving you wondering: "How sure are you?" This project was born out of frustration with these sketchy setups.

## What Is It?

 REAL Free Image Converter is a simple, client-side web application that allows you to convert various image formats (TIFF, PSD, ICO, PDF, and more) into common formats like PNG, JPEG, or WEBP directly in your browser. All processing is done on your device, so your files never leave your computer.

## Why Use It?

- **No Paywalls:** Completely free with no hidden fees.
- **Privacy:** Files are processed locally in your browser—no uploading to any server.
- **Trustworthy:** Unlike other services that promise to delete your files after processing, our converter does not send your data anywhere.
- **Convenience:** Use it on your phone, tablet, or desktop without worrying about sketchy servers.

## Features

- **Multi-Format Support:**  
  Convert TIFF, PSD, ICO, PDF (all pages), and standard image formats (PNG, JPEG, WEBP) without limitations.
  
- **Local Processing:**  
  All conversions are performed on your device for complete privacy.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**  
  A clean, responsive design inspired by modern minimalism. Works seamlessly on mobile and desktop.

- **Batch Conversion & ZIP Download:**  
  Easily convert multiple files at once. If you convert more than one file (or a multi-page PDF), you can download them as a ZIP archive.

## How to Use

1. **Select Files:**  
   Click on the "Select image files" button and choose one or more files from your device.
   
2. **Choose Output Format:**  
   Select the desired output format (JPEG, PNG, or WEBP) from the dropdown menu.

3. **Adjust Quality:**  
   (For JPEG/WEBP only) Use the quality slider to set the conversion quality (higher quality means larger file size).

4. **Convert:**  
   Click the "Convert Images" button. You'll see a progress spinner while the conversion is in process.

5. **Download:**  
   Once conversion is complete, preview your files and download them directly or as a ZIP archive if multiple files are converted.

## Why This Converter?

Many online converters process your files on remote servers, leaving you with privacy concerns—even if they claim to delete your files afterward. With REAL Free Image Converter, everything is done locally. This means:
  
- **Total Privacy:** Your files never leave your device.
- **Trust & Transparency:** No data is sent to any external server.
- **Ease of Use:** Conversion is as simple as it is fast.
